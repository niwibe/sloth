= Sloth

== How to start

First of all, install link:http://leiningen.org/[leiningen].

=== Backend

Used mainly for serving the index.html in /.

----
$ git clone git@github.com:niwibe/sloth.git
$ cd sloth
$ lein with-profile standalone run

=== ClojureScript compiler

Used for compiling the frontend application.

----
$ cd sloth
$ lein cljsbuild auto devel
Compiling ClojureScript.
Compiling "resources/public/js/app.js" from ["src/cljs"]...
----

You can use `normal` build id (instead of `devel`) for build with in 
`:whitespace` optimization instead of `:none`. That increases compilation 
times but improves page load speed.


=== Frontend development dependencies

You need *ruby*, *nodejs*, *bundler*, *gulp* and *bower* installed.

Install ruby and nodejs from your operating system package manager.

Install bundler using _gem_ in a user home directory:

----
$ gem install --user-install bundler
----

This installs the binaries that comes in gem's in location like
this: _~/.gem/ruby/2.1.0/bin/_, and you should add this path to you PATH
variable.

Having ruby and bundler installed, you need install all dependencies
for the SASS compiler:

----
$ bundle install
Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/.............
Installing sass 3.4.9
Installing thor 0.19.1
Installing bourbon 4.0.2
Using bundler 1.7.9
Your bundle is complete!
It was installed into ./vendor
----

Install gulp at operating system level:

----
$ sudo npm install -g gulp bower
----

And, now, having gulp installed, install all dependencies needed for running
gulp:

----
$ npm install
----

After having installed all dependencies, execute gulp for compile _scss_ files. Gulp
serves the application in link:http://localhost:9000[localhost's 9000 port] for convenience,
so there's no need to run the backend:

----
$ gulp
----

=== Browser enabled REPL

All dependencies and settings for making work browser enabled repl
are ready, but disabled by default.

For enable it, uncomment the `(ws-repl/connect ...)` on
_src/cljs/sloth/core.cljs_.

And start the browser enabled repl.

----
$ lein repl
nREPL server started on port 57849 on host 127.0.0.1 - nrepl://127.0.0.1:57849
REPL-y 0.3.5, nREPL 0.2.6

=== Hiccup generation from HTML template

For generating the hiccup equivalent of the HTML template, run the following command:

----
$ lein hicv 2clj resources/public/sandbox/index.html
----

=== Packaging as node-webkit application.

The sloth application can run as standalone application in node-webkit environment.
For create a node-webkit package, execute:

----
$ gulp package
----

That will generate a sloth-x.y.z.nw file in target directory. You can run the application
executing it with `nw`:

----
$ nw target/sloth-0.1.0.nw
----

=== Setup XMPP server (ejabberd)

This step is only necessary if you want to have local jabber server.

Install ejabberd using your package manager. In case of Archlinux execute as root:

----
# pacman -S ejabberd
----

Now, having server installed you have different ways to start it. If you want
start a server temporary, you can do it directly with _ejabberdctl_ command:

----
# For start server
ejabberdctl start

# For stop server
ejabberdctl stop
----

Server started with ejabberdctl allow interact with them without changing the user.

An other way (recommended) is starting it using the systemd:

----
systemctl start ejabberd
----

In this case, if you want interact with server using _ejabberdctl_ command, you should
change to ejabberd user (using `su - ejabberd`)

For example, I recommend to setup an empty password for ejabberd user. This will allow 
you to switch to the ejabberd user without the need to remember another password or 
using the root user first.


Now, as _ejabberd_ user, create an user in ejabberd server:

----
ejabberdctl register user localhost password
----
